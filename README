FrikQCC 2.7:  QuakeC Compiler
-----

Frikqcc is released under the GNU General Public License

I have a recent interest in Quake modding, however there are no available QuakeC compilers for OS X 10.7.
Luckily, source is available for many of the better compilers back in their prime.  
This is just a rehost with a little bit of cleanup work done in order to get a working version.


Summary of my changes/additions:

qcc.c:
-----
FUNCTION char *PR_GlobalStringNoContents (gofs_t ofs)
LINE 625
   // Heinekev 5/12/2012
   // addressed error below by commenting out offending line (can't find what it's intended purpose is)
   //
   // qcc.c:625:4: error: use of undeclared identifier 'plock'
   //                        plock=blah;
   //                        ^
   // qcc.c:625:10: error: use of undeclared identifier 'blah'
   //                        plock=blah;
   //	plock=blah;

main.c:
------
FUNCTION int main (int argc, char **argv)
LINE 170
// write progdefs.h

	crc = PR_WriteProgdefs ("progdefs.h");
		// Heinekev 5/12/2012
		// addressed error below -
		// if (p = PR_FindDefine("SYSTEM_CRC"))
		// ERROR: main.c:166:8: note: use '==' to turn this assignment into an equality comparison
	if (p == PR_FindDefine("SYSTEM_CRC")) 
		crc = pr_defines[p].value._float;


ORIGINAL AUTHORS DESCRIPTION BELOW:
-----

FrikQCC started just before the Quake engine source release last year. Based off of Johathan Roy's FastQCC, I tried to bring new features to the code to make Quake more appealing a language to high nosed programmers that said it wasn't a 'proper language'.
Early in 2000, JP Grossman released qccx, which proved to be a major turning point in frikqcc. Though most of his engine data hacking features leave me a bit dry, the optimizations really got my mind working in overdrive.
